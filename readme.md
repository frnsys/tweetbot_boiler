# TwitKit

A very simple Twitter bot starting point.

To use it:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ftzeng/tweetbot_boiler.git
$ cd tweetbot_boiler
$ pip install requirements.txt
$ cp config-sample.py config.py

# Fill in your Twitter API info into config.py
# Visit https://apps.twitter.com/ to get it if you don't have it.
```

Some very simple example bots are in `examples/`. You'll need to install
their requirements separately (`examples/requirements.txt`).
